`store-worker` is a simple and efficient way to manage persistent configuration in Node.js or Electron applications. It leverages worker threads to handle storage operations, ensuring that your main process remains responsive.

## Installation

### NPM

```
npm install store-worker
```

```js
import Store from 'store-worker';
```

## Usage

```js
const store = new Store({
  saveThrottle: 10000, // The number of milliseconds to wait before saving the store to disk after a change. This can help to reduce the number of disk writes when making frequent changes to the store.
  ... // other serializable options are pass to Conf instance 
});

// Set a value
store.set('unicorn', 'ðŸ¦„');

// Get a value
console.log(store.get('unicorn'));
//=> 'ðŸ¦„'

// Delete a value
store.delete('unicorn');
```

Serializable options are pass to [Conf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/conf).
